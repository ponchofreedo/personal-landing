# My personal landing page

This project is built with Vue.

## Follow along with the progress
[Figma 2024-2025 project](https://www.figma.com/design/PmxHjTSPd169MTszaWe6ql/Site?node-id=0-1&t=FVnq9c7RyTfQZ1Mc-1)
<br>
The plan is to build this in phases as I have time.
* Phase 1 - New landing page skeleton
* Phase 2 - Introduce some extra content
* Phase 3 - Add project blocks
* Phase 4 - Add CV to SPA
* Phase 5 - Move project content to individual pages in the app instead of linking out
